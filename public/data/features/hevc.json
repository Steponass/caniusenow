  "description": "The High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) compression standard is a video compression format intended to succeed H.264. It is hard for browsers to universally support HEVC because it is [complex and expensive to license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding#Patent_licensing). HEVC competes with [AV1](/av1) which has similar compression quality and provides a free license.",
